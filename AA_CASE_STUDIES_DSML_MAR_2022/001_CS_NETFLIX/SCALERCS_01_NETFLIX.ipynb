    "The exploration should have a goal. As you explore the data, keep in mind that you want to answer which type of shows to produce and how to grow the business. Ensure each recommendation is backed by data. The company is looking for data-driven insights, not personal opinions or anecdotes. Assume that you are presenting your findings to business executives who have only a basic understanding of data science. Avoid unnecessary technical jargon. Start by exploring a few questions: What type of content is available in different countries? How has the number of movies released per year changed over the last 20-30 years? Comparison of tv shows vs. movies. What is the best time to launch a TV show? Analysis of actors/directors of different types of shows/movies. Does Netflix has more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years Understanding what content is available in different countries Evaluation Criteria (100 Points):"
