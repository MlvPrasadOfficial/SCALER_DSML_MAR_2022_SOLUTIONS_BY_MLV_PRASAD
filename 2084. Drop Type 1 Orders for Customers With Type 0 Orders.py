SQL Schema
Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| order_id    | int  | 
| customer_id | int  |
| order_type  | int  | 
+-------------+------+
order_id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order, the ID of the customer who ordered it, and the order type.
The orders could be of type 0 or type 1.
 

Write an SQL query to report all the orders based on the following criteria:

If a customer has at least one order of type 0, do not report any order of type 1 from that customer.
Otherwise, report all the orders of the customer.
Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Orders table:
+----------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | customer_id | order_type |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 1           | 0          |
| 2        | 1           | 0          |
| 11       | 2           | 0          |
| 12       | 2           | 1          |
| 21       | 3           | 1          |
| 22       | 3           | 0          |
| 31       | 4           | 1          |
| 32       | 4           | 1          |
+----------+-------------+------------+
Output: 
+----------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | customer_id | order_type |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 31       | 4           | 1          |
| 32       | 4           | 1          |
| 1        | 1           | 0          |
| 2        | 1           | 0          |
| 11       | 2           | 0          |
| 22       | 3           | 0          |
+----------+-------------+------------+
Explanation: 
Customer 1 has two orders of type 0. We return both of them.
Customer 2 has one order of type 0 and one order of type 1. We only return the order of type 0.
Customer 3 has one order of type 0 and one order of type 1. We only return the order of type 0.
Customer 4 has two orders of type 1. We return both of them.









/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */


with cte as (
select *, min(order_type) over(partition by customer_id) as min_order_type
from Orders)


select order_id, customer_id, order_type
from cte
where (order_type + min_order_type <> 1)
