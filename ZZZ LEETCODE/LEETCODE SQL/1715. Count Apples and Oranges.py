Table: Chests

chest_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the chests and the corresponding number of oranges and apples they have.
 

Write an SQL query to count the number of apples and oranges in all the boxes. If a box contains a chest, you should also include the number of apples and oranges it has.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Boxes table:
+--------+----------+-------------+--------------+
| box_id | chest_id | apple_count | orange_count |
+--------+----------+-------------+--------------+
| 2      | null     | 6           | 15           |
| 18     | 14       | 4           | 15           |
| 19     | 3        | 8           | 4            |
| 12     | 2        | 19          | 20           |
| 20     | 6        | 12          | 9            |
| 8      | 6        | 9           | 9            |
| 3      | 14       | 16          | 7            |
+--------+----------+-------------+--------------+
Chests table:
+----------+-------------+--------------+
| chest_id | apple_count | orange_count |
+----------+-------------+--------------+
| 6        | 5           | 6            |
| 14       | 20          | 10           |
| 2        | 8           | 8            |
| 3        | 19          | 4            |
| 16       | 19          | 19           |
+----------+-------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-------------+--------------+
| apple_count | orange_count |
+-------------+--------------+
| 151         | 123          |
+-------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
box 2 has 6 apples and 15 oranges.
box 18 has 4 + 20 (from the chest) = 24 apples and 15 + 10 (from the chest) = 25 oranges.
box 19 has 8 + 19 (from the chest) = 27 apples and 4 + 4 (from the chest) = 8 oranges.
box 12 has 19 + 8 (from the chest) = 27 apples and 20 + 8 (from the chest) = 28 oranges.
box 20 has 12 + 5 (from the chest) = 17 apples and 9 + 6 (from the chest) = 15 oranges.
box 8 has 9 + 5 (from the chest) = 14 apples and 9 + 6 (from the chest) = 15 oranges.
box 3 has 16 + 20 (from the chest) = 36 apples and 7 + 10 (from the chest) = 17 oranges.
Total number of apples = 6 + 24 + 27 + 27 + 17 + 14 + 36 = 151
Total number of oranges = 15 + 25 + 8 + 28 + 15 + 15 + 17 = 123
