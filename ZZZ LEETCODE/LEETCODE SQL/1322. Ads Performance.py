SQL Schema
Table: Ads

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| ad_id         | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| action        | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
(ad_id, user_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of an Ad, the ID of a user, and the action taken by this user regarding this Ad.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('Clicked', 'Viewed', 'Ignored').
 

A company is running Ads and wants to calculate the performance of each Ad.

Performance of the Ad is measured using Click-Through Rate (CTR) where:


Write an SQL query to find the ctr of each Ad. Round ctr to two decimal points.

Return the result table ordered by ctr in descending order and by ad_id in ascending order in case of a tie.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Ads table:
+-------+---------+---------+
| ad_id | user_id | action  |
+-------+---------+---------+
| 1     | 1       | Clicked |
| 2     | 2       | Clicked |
| 3     | 3       | Viewed  |
| 5     | 5       | Ignored |
| 1     | 7       | Ignored |
| 2     | 7       | Viewed  |
| 3     | 5       | Clicked |
| 1     | 4       | Viewed  |
| 2     | 11      | Viewed  |
| 1     | 2       | Clicked |
+-------+---------+---------+
Output: 
+-------+-------+
| ad_id | ctr   |
+-------+-------+
| 1     | 66.67 |
| 3     | 50.00 |
| 2     | 33.33 |
| 5     | 0.00  |
+-------+-------+
Explanation: 
for ad_id = 1, ctr = (2/(2+1)) * 100 = 66.67
for ad_id = 2, ctr = (1/(1+2)) * 100 = 33.33
for ad_id = 3, ctr = (1/(1+1)) * 100 = 50.00
for ad_id = 5, ctr = 0.00, Note that ad_id = 5 has no clicks or views.
Note that we do not care about Ignored Ads.




/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select ad_id, 
Round(ISNULL(sum( case when action = 'Clicked' then 1 end) * 1.0 * 100/ NULLIF(sum(case when action in ('Clicked', 'Viewed') then 1 end),0),0),2) as ctr
from ads
group by ad_id
order by 2 desc, 1
