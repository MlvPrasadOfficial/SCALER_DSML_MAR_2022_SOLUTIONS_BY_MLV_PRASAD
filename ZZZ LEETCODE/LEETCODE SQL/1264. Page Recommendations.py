Write an SQL query to recommend pages to the user with user_id = 1 using the pages that your friends liked. It should not recommend pages you already liked.

Return result table in any order without duplicates.

The query result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
User one is friend with users 2, 3, 4 and 6.
Suggested pages are 23 from user 2, 24 from user 3, 56 from user 3 and 33 from user 6.
Page 77 is suggested from both user 2 and user 3.
Page 88 is not suggested because user 1 already likes it.
