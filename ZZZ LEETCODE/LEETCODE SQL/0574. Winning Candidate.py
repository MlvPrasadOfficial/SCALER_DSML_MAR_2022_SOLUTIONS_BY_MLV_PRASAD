SQL Schema
Table: Candidate

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id and the name of a candidate.
 

Table: Vote

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| candidateId | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is an auto-increment primary key.
candidateId is a foreign key to id from the Candidate table.
Each row of this table determines the candidate who got the ith vote in the elections.
 

Write an SQL query to report the name of the winning candidate (i.e., the candidate who got the largest number of votes).

The test cases are generated so that exactly one candidate wins the elections.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Candidate table:
+----+------+
| id | name |
+----+------+
| 1  | A    |
| 2  | B    |
| 3  | C    |
| 4  | D    |
| 5  | E    |
+----+------+
Vote table:
+----+-------------+
| id | candidateId |
+----+-------------+
| 1  | 2           |
| 2  | 4           |
| 3  | 3           |
| 4  | 2           |
| 5  | 5           |
+----+-------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| B    |
+------+
Explanation: 
Candidate B has 2 votes. Candidates C, D, and E have 1 vote each.
The winner is candidate B.










/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
with a as
(
select top(1) CandidateId, count(distinct id) conts   from vote
    group by CandidateId
    order by count(distinct id) desc
)


select name from Candidate
where id in (select distinct CandidateId from a)
