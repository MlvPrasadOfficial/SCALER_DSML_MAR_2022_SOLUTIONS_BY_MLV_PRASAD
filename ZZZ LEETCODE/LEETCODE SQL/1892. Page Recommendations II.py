You are implementing a page recommendation system for a social media website. Your system will recommended a page to user_id if the page is liked by at least one friend of user_id and is not liked by user_id.

Write an SQL query to find all the possible page recommendations for every user. Each recommendation should appear as a row in the result table with these columns:

user_id: The ID of the user that your system is making the recommendation to.
page_id: The ID of the page that will be recommended to user_id.
friends_likes: The number of the friends of user_id that like page_id.
Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |

Explanation: 
Take user 1 as an example:
  - User 1 is friends with users 2, 3, 4, and 6.
  - Recommended pages are 23 (user 2 liked it), 24 (user 3 liked it), 56 (user 3 liked it), 33 (user 6 liked it), and 77 (user 2 and user 3 liked it).
  - Note that page 88 is not recommended because user 1 already liked it.

Another example is user 6:
  - User 6 is friends with user 1.
  - User 1 only liked page 88, but user 6 already liked it. Hence, user 6 has no recommendations.

You can recommend pages for users 2, 3, 4, and 5 using a similar process.









/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
WITH all_friends as(
SELECT user1_id as u1, user2_id as u2
FROM Friendship
UNION ALL 
SELECT user2_id as u1, user1_id as u2
FROM Friendship
)

SELECT af.u1 AS user_id, l1.page_id, COUNT(*) AS friends_likes
FROM all_friends AS af
JOIN Likes AS l1 ON l1.user_id = af.u2
LEFT JOIN Likes AS l2 ON l2.user_id = af.u1 AND l1.page_id = l2.page_id
WHERE l2.user_id is null
GROUP BY af.u1,l1.page_id
