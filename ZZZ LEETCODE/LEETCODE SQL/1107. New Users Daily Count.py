SQL Schema
Table: Traffic

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| activity      | enum    |
| activity_date | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity column is an ENUM type of ('login', 'logout', 'jobs', 'groups', 'homepage').
 

Write an SQL query to reports for every date within at most 90 days from today, the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is 2019-06-30.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Traffic table:
+---------+----------+---------------+
| user_id | activity | activity_date |
+---------+----------+---------------+
| 1       | login    | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | homepage | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | logout   | 2019-05-01    |
| 2       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 2       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 3       | login    | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | jobs     | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | logout   | 2019-01-01    |
| 4       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | groups   | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
+---------+----------+---------------+
Output: 
+------------+-------------+
| login_date | user_count  |
+------------+-------------+
| 2019-05-01 | 1           |
| 2019-06-21 | 2           |
+------------+-------------+
Explanation: 
Note that we only care about dates with non zero user count.
The user with id 5 first logged in on 2019-03-01 so he's not counted on 2019-06-21.




/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
with a as (select user_id, min(activity_date) min_dt  from Traffic
where activity = 'login'
group by user_id 
having min(activity_date) between dateadd(day, -90, '2019-06-30') and dateadd(day, 90, '2019-06-30')
           )

select min_dt as login_date, count(distinct user_id) user_count from a
group by min_dt
