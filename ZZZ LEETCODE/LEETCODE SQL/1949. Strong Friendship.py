SQL Schema
Table: Friendship

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user1_id    | int  |
| user2_id    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the users user1_id and user2_id are friends.
Note that user1_id < user2_id.
 

A friendship between a pair of friends x and y is strong if x and y have at least three common friends.

Write an SQL query to find all the strong friendships.

Note that the result table should not contain duplicates with user1_id < user2_id.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 1        | 5        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 1        | 7        |
| 3        | 7        |
| 1        | 6        |
| 3        | 6        |
| 2        | 6        |
+----------+----------+
Output: 
+----------+----------+---------------+
| user1_id | user2_id | common_friend |
+----------+----------+---------------+
| 1        | 2        | 4             |
| 1        | 3        | 3             |
+----------+----------+---------------+
Explanation: 
Users 1 and 2 have 4 common friends (3, 4, 5, and 6).
Users 1 and 3 have 3 common friends (2, 6, and 7).
We did not include the friendship of users 2 and 3 because they only have two common friends (1 and 6).






/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

with f as (
select user1_id, user2_id 
from Friendship
union 
select user2_id user1_id, user1_id user2_id
from Friendship
)

select a.user1_id, a.user2_id, count(c.user2_id) common_friend
from Friendship a 
join f b 
on a.user1_id = b.user1_id 
join f c 
on a.user2_id = c.user1_id 
and b.user2_id = c.user2_id 
group by a.user1_id, a.user2_id
having count(c.user2_id) >= 3
