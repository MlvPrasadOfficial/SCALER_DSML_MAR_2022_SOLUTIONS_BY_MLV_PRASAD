purchase_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains logs of the dates that users purchased from a certain retailer.
 

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the users that made any two purchases at most 7 days apart.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

| 5           | 7       | 2022-06-19    |
| 2           | 2       | 2022-06-08    |
+-------------+---------+---------------+
Output: 
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 2       |
| 7       |
+---------+
Explanation: 
User 2 had two purchases on 2022-03-13 and 2022-03-20. Since the second purchase is within 7 days of the first purchase, we add their ID.
User 5 had only 1 purchase.
User 7 had two purchases on the same day so we add their ID.
